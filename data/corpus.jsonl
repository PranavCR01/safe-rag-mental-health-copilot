{"id":"CBT_1","source_id":"CBT_exam","ns":"cbt","text":"Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) for exam anxiety identifies negative thought patterns: catastrophizing ('I'll fail and ruin everything'), all-or-nothing thinking ('Perfect score or total failure'), and mind reading ('Everyone thinks I'm incompetent'). The CBT process: 1) Notice the anxious thought, 2) Ask 'What evidence supports this?', 3) Ask 'What evidence contradicts this?', 4) Generate a balanced alternative thought. Example: 'I might fail' becomes 'I'm prepared and will do my best; one exam doesn't define me.'"}
{"id":"CBT_3","source_id":"Grounding_CBT","ns":"cbt","text":"The 5-4-3-2-1 grounding technique stops panic attacks and acute anxiety within 2-3 minutes. Steps: Name 5 things you SEE, 4 things you can TOUCH, 3 things you can HEAR, 2 things you can SMELL, 1 thing you can TASTE. This activates your parasympathetic nervous system (calming response) and interrupts the panic cycle. Use before exams, during study breaks, or whenever overwhelmed."}
{"id":"CBT_4","source_id":"Breathing_CBT","ns":"cbt","text":"Box breathing (used by Navy SEALs): Inhale for 4 counts, hold for 4, exhale for 4, hold for 4. Repeat 4-6 cycles. This lowers heart rate and cortisol within 2 minutes. Practice daily so it becomes automatic, then use before exams or when anxiety spikes. Alternative: 4-7-8 breathing (inhale 4, hold 7, exhale 8) for deeper relaxation."}
{"id":"MOOD_1","source_id":"Mood_tracking","ns":"mood","text":"Mood tracking reveals patterns you can't see day-to-day.

Does morning study = less anxiety? Which coping strategies help? This data helps you make informed changes. The act of tracking itself increases self-awareness and sense of control."}
{"id":"TEST_1","source_id":"Test_anxiety","ns":"test-anxiety","text":"Test anxiety affects 55% of students. During an exam, if panic hits: 1) Close your eyes, 2) Take 3 slow deep breaths, 3) Tell yourself 'This is just anxiety, it will pass', 4) Resume starting with an easy question. Don't fight the anxiety (makes it worse); acknowledge it exists and continue anyway. Anxiety peaks at 10 minutes then naturally decreases if you don't fuel it with catastrophic thoughts."}
{"id":"STUDY_1","source_id":"Active_recall","ns":"study-skills","text":"Active recall (testing yourself) beats re-reading by 200%. Methods: flashcards (test before looking at answers), practice problems without checking solutions first, explaining concepts out loud as if teaching someone. Use the 'struggle principle': if it feels too easy, it's not working. Aim for 70% correct on practice. Schedule: 70% of study time on active recall, 30% on initial review."}
{"id":"SOCIAL_1","source_id":"Social_support","ns":"social-support","text":"Social support reduces exam stress by 30-40%. Choose supportive friends who listen without judgment or comparison. Avoid: competitive study groups that increase anxiety, friends who dismiss your feelings, toxic positivity. Good support: study partners who explain patiently, friends who validate stress while offering perspective. If you don't have this, university counseling provides professional support."}

{"id":"NUT_1","source_id":"Nutrition_exam","ns":"wellness","text":"Nutrition impacts exam performance. Before exams: eat protein + complex carbs (eggs and oatmeal) 2-3 hours prior for sustained energy. Avoid: simple sugars (crash after 30 minutes), heavy foods (digestive discomfort), trying new foods, skipping meals. During exams: bring water and healthy snacks (nuts, fruit). Even 2% dehydration reduces cognitive performance by 10-15%. Caffeine: max 200mg before noon only."}
{"id":"EXER_1","source_id":"Exercise_anxiety","ns":"wellness","text":"Exercise reduces anxiety for 2-4 hours after just 20 minutes of moderate activity. Best for exam stress: walking, jogging, yoga, swimming. Even 10 minutes before an exam helps. Why: increases endorphins, reduces cortisol, improves blood flow to brain. Don't need a gym: climb stairs, walk between classes, bodyweight exercises. Aim for 30 minutes 5 days/week. Morning exercise = better sleep at night."}
{"id":"RESIL_1","source_id":"Resilience","ns":"long-term","text":"Building long-term resilience: maintain routines year-round (sleep, meals, exercise) not just during exams, develop diverse identity (clubs, hobbies, relationships - not just 'student'), practice stress management consistently, build support network before crisis, keep 'wins folder' (save positive feedback to review when doubting yourself), develop growth mindset. Resilience is a skill that strengthens with practice."}
{"id":"TIME_1","source_id":"Time_management","ns":"study-skills","text":"Time management reduces last-minute panic. At semester start: write down all exam dates, break projects into weekly milestones, use time-blocking. Weekly: review and adjust, build in buffer time. Daily: tackle hardest task first when fresh, schedule breaks as non-negotiable. Tools: Google Calendar, Todoist, or paper planners. Key: find what works for YOUR brain and stick with it."}
{"id":"MIND_1","source_id":"Mindfulness","ns":"mindfulness","text":"Mindfulness for exam anxiety: sit comfortably, focus on breath, when mind wanders to worries, gently return to breath. Start with 5 minutes daily, build to 10-15 minutes. Benefits after 2 weeks: 20-30% reduction in baseline anxiety, better emotional regulation, improved focus. Use during study breaks or when overwhelmed. Apps: Headspace, Calm, Insight Timer. Mindfulness teaches that thoughts are just thoughts, not facts."}
